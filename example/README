This is a silly little example that shows how you
can use AnyEvent::WebSocket::Client.

 - jobserver is a Mojolicious::Lite app (also requires Mojo::Redis
   and a redis server running on localhost) that cordinates and
   displays job output.
 
 - jobrunner is an AnyEvent::WebSocket::Client program that runs a
   program locally and sends the output as events via WebSocket
   to jobserver.
 
 - slowlast is just a program that runs last -30 very slowly so
   that you can see the output update on the server.
   
 - jobviewer is an AnyEvent::WebSocket::Client program that attaches
   to the jobserver and displays a job as it isrunning via 
   WebSockets.
